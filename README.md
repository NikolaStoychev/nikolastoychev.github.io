## AnimesRockDB Single Page Application

AnimesRockDB is a very simple SPA project that I made to demonstate my skills in JavaScript.

### Philosophy
- lit-html - a small standalone library for rendering and partial updating of templates
- page.js - a compact clint-side router used for pagination
- Backendless - visual app development platform used to store the data for the SPA

### Getting Started
- Download the files
- Install the required npm packages `npm install`
