## AnimesRockDB Single Page Application

AnimesRockDB is a very simple SPA project that I made to demonstrate my skills in JavaScript.

### Philosophy
- lit-html - a small standalone library for rendering and partial updating of templates
- page.js - a compact client-side router used for pagination
- Backendless - visual app development platform used to store the data for the SPA

### Getting Started
- Download the files
- Install the required npm packages `npm install`
- Install Live Server or HTTP Server extension in order to run the SPA on your computer
- Run the `index.html` file with Live Server or HTTP Server

### Features
- Browsing through the already created collections
- Ability to create new accounts or login with existing accounts
- Ability to create or edit user collections
- Ability to search through the created collections

### Registered users
- `test1@test.com` with password `1234`
- `test2@test.com` with password `1234`
- `test3@test.com` with password `1234`
